# Geodesic-StarShip
Computer Innards of the Geodesic StarShip

Core Systems & Technologies

1. User Interface App
	•	A centralized information hub that integrates with crew members’ phones.
	•	Allows users to filter and control the information they receive, organizing it into a customized Starfleet-style interface for efficiency and immersion.

2. Mesh Network Communication System
	•	A decentralized, private communication system using mesh networking.
	•	Enables direct communication between crew members without relying on external Wi-Fi or cell service.
	•	Can be used for camp coordination, mission updates, and in-game interactions.

3. AI-Integrated Main Computer
	•	An offline AI assistant that can be trained and linked to different ship systems.
	•	Crew members can tap their combadge to access AI functions, such as:
	•	Checking camp status and schedules.
	•	Interacting with in-game elements.
	•	Receiving mission updates or responding to challenges.

4. Laser Tag System
	•	A camp-wide and burn-wide interactive laser tag game with a mission-based system.
	•	Players can participate in combat, exploration, puzzle-solving, and team-based objectives.
	•	The system will include a map and storyline that evolves based on player choices.
	•	Other burners can opt in, allowing the game to expand beyond our camp.

5. Tricorder Data Collection
	•	Handheld devices that can scan environmental data (temperature, sound, motion, air quality, etc.).
	•	Data can be used to train the AI, provide real-time environmental readings, or trigger in-game events.

Next Steps

These systems are still in the development phase. The goal is to start with basic prototypes and expand their capabilities over time. Right now, we need to:
	•	Determine what’s feasible for this year’s build.
	•	Identify people with technical, engineering, or creative skills to contribute.
	•	Work on prototyping and testing small-scale versions before full integration.
